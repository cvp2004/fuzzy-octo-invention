"""AsyncRWLock — async readers-writer lock with writer preference.

Writer preference: once a writer is waiting, new readers block.
This prevents writer starvation under continuous read load.

Usage::

    lock = AsyncRWLock()

    async with lock.read_lock():
        # multiple readers can be here simultaneously
        ...

    async with lock.write_lock():
        # exclusive access — waits for readers, blocks new ones
        ...
